## Stem Cell Management

Stem  cells  are  cells  taken  from  embryos  or  adult  body  tissues  which  have  the 
properties to differentiate  into  specialized  cells.  Stems  cell  transplants  have  been used  
to  cure  many  chronic  diseases  like  cancer,  immune  disorders,  metabolic disorders and has 
become a very promising area which saves many dying lives.

Stem   Cell   Management   (SCM)   database   system   provides   the   benefits   of : 
* streamlined operations
* enhanced control of transplant details 
* secured method of data  access  
* improved search  for  available  stem  cells  for  new  transplants
* easy   search   of   centers   for  users   interested  in  donation.  

The  proposed  SCM system  is  flexible,  powerful,  easy  to  use  and  is  developed  to  deliver  immensive benefits to __hospitals, patients and public users__. 

Stem Cell Management  system  is custom  built  to  meet  all  the  __needs  of  hospitals__  in   finding  the  available  stem cells,   transplant   centers   in   storing  all   the   data   of  previous   transplants   and common  users  for  finding  centers  for  donation.  The  software has  the  facility  of different logins  which  give  access  to  different  data  stored  in  the software.  The facilities include easy searching  of  the  available  stem  cells  at  nearest locations for  patients  who  will  be  undergoing transplants, storing and retrieving data of all previous  transplants  and  all  the  details   related   to   the   transplants   which includes the  transplant  center,  disease  for  which  transplant  has  been  done,  cell source and all the details of the patients and finally an easy search option is made available for enthusiastic users who are willing to donate stem cells.
